  ## Installation 
  This application requires inquirer, path, fs, and util

  ## User-Story 
  When the user first opens the application, they must run an npm install. Once that is completed, the user can run the app.js file using node. The app will ask a series of questions about their employees. The questions will gather the employees' contact info, and will also have specific questions depending on whether they are a manager, engineer, or intern. The user can add multiple employees. Once each round of questions is complete for the specific employee, their information will store in an array. That array will pull into a render function, which will produce a specific html template depending on the employee's role. Those templates are then gathered into a single html file which will be titled "team.html" and will be located in the output folder. 

## What I Learned from this Assignment
This project provided a great opportunity to work with detailed instructions and test. I feel that this was a fantastic example of a real-life simulation of how projects can be in a real work environment. It was also one of the first assignments which combined multiple lessons to build an actual application, which I enjoyed.

## Where I can Improve
It was challenging for me to read the test script. I do see how writing tests can be beneficial for the success of a project and keeping the developer on task. I want more opportunities to explore translating test script into functioning code. I believe there are opportunities for error in this app, as there are no rules coded for the inquirer prompts, which code leads to issues in the answer.
